          The Story Behind Chess Anywhere
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Chess Anywhere has its roots in an old idea that had been brewing for years. The concept of a URL-encoded 
          chess game had long been a fascinating thought experiment, but it needed the right technology and approach 
          to become a reality.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          In the summer of 2024, during a break, the project finally took shape. The game's creator, despite not 
          having played much chess in recent years, had held onto this innovative idea. To bring it to life, they 
          turned to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an advanced AI language model.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Over the course of just a few days, Chess Anywhere was developed almost entirely through collaboration 
          with Claude. This unique development process allowed for rapid iteration and problem-solving, turning a 
          long-held idea into a functional, innovative chess platform.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          The result is a testament to the power of persistent ideas and the potential of AI-assisted development 
          in bringing novel concepts to life.
